----NOTICE----

This notice (henceforth refered to as "the notice"), which constitutes all the text starting from (including) "----NOTICE----" and ending at "----END OF NOTICE----",
is provided for clarification only, and does not constitute a legally binding statement, but rather meant to clarify intentions 
regarding the project licencing.  
In case of conflicting statements between the notice and any of the licences in the project, the statements in the licences will take precedence.

The project was initially meant to be published fully under the LGPL 3.0 licence (as defined at https://opensource.org/licenses/LGPL-3.0).
However, after revision, it made no sence for certein parts of it (or rather, most parts of it) to be published that way,
as the only things meant to stay static between projects were the Handlers (a part of the framework which includes various classes), 
while everything else (every API, plugins, include modules, main script, etc) were only meant to provide a basic, but not definitive 
way to use the framework to run a web based system.  
Projects are expected to create their own APIs (likely from the provided APIs), adjusting them to their needs. As most of the 
authorization should be done at the API level, and include business logic definitions specific to that those projects, 
it is not reasonable to expect each project using this framework to share their APIs and expose parts of their specific business logic.

As such, all files in this project will be published under the MIT License )(as defined at https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT), except for 
specific files that include licence information in a comment near the top of the file. 
In case of conflict, the licence information listed or linked inside each individual file is to take precedence.

As a small note, this framework uses a few external dependancies. Their licences are as defined by the owners of said dependancies.

Under this notice is the MIT licence, which is the default licence for files in this project.
