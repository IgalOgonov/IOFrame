TODO
----
Add object-based auth handler (to be independant of "objects") - objects, objects to objects, and users to objects auth actions.
----
Add reocuring time-based auth (e.g valid only on mondays between 14:00 - 19:00)
----
Add different test modes.

Add a standard Default content generator for the database (for testing purposes).

Add global users data API (that isn't just Auth)
----
Implement security check functions
